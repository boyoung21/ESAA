3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

comfy leather seats .\\n33   The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Seats are very comfortable and ride is very smooth !\\n32

comfy leather seats .\\n33   The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35

location is great, I opted for a Fisherman's wharf stay for vacation having stayed near Union square on business in the past and I'm glad I did as it was easy walking distance to Chinatown and the touristy area of the wharf .\\n90                                                                                                                                            Location of the hotel was ideal to explore the know attractions, with just a 2 min walk to the wharf   ferries and the famous cable cars, which transported you to union square  lombard st etc .\\n91

trip here, take your hire car back after you have unloaded your luggage and get a taxi to the airport .\\n92

                                                  Another word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website ,  VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying \\u00a317 more per night than I'd expected

                           The shower pressure was a bit low but that's the price you pay for the top floor and it was well worth it  ,  Instead of minibar there was an empty fridge which came quite handy for our own beverages, I doubt they would have milk in their minibar  ,  Tea and coffee making facilites and iron with board were a great bonus to what we had expected from our room .\\n91

                                                Overall the OS just 'feels' faster, snappier, and easier to use .\\n14

cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again\\n176

                     The service is pleasant enough, and I was given a room with a nice view of central London   on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

                                      This is suppose to be a full service hotle, but I would only classify it at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n72

and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

nothing to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50



nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46

adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

                                                                           The only possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

                                                                                                                         Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                        It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom was also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was clean but a little dated .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                        The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

Plenty of room in the bathroom .\\n78

                                     The only minor downside, as a few others have mentioned, is the bathroom sink lighting .\\n80

               Did not like the bathroom light shining into bedroom   .\\n81

is a little small .\\n82

                                                             The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

         Styling is bland, the engine isn't strong at all, and the car doesn't deliver good comfort while driving it .\\n9

                                 It's a pretty good car, reliable, comfortable as far as it goes, but limited rear visibility because of high rear bumper, and a problem with its computer  learning  my  driving style .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                             The

                               I've had 3 BMWs and only one of them could offer a more comfortable ride than the Camry .\\n15

enjoy the experience .\\n18                                                                                                         While the 4 cylinder does not have the punch of the Honda Accord 4 cylinder, the comfort and quietness of the ride won out .\\n19

                                                             I feel uncomfortable driving this car and will get rid of it .\\n21

                                                 You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .\\n27

                                                           I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35

would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                       The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42

                                    Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46

                                                  The seats are way to low to the ground making long drives uncomfortable .\\n74

                                                                        Toyota made many improvements since 03, including more comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   .\\n76

straight forward and the take off power is quite impressive .\\n78

longer trips, however, they have a tendency to fall asleep, , which I think emphasizes how comfortable, smooth, and quiet it is .\\n80

             I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 The navigation works

have to say the car rode great,comfortable and gas mileage great .\\n84                                                                                                                                   I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a comfortable ride as well as good fuel economy .\\n85                                                                                                                             The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                   Comfortable and quiet with excellent gas mileage

expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .\\n92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

                 The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields

far, no problems .\\n37                                                                                                                              Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .\\n38                                                                                                                                                          The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .\\n39                                                                                                                                                  So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40

                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64

  Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69

mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71

keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76

drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80

                                  It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better

speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Service was all good, albeit a bit stoic .\\n32                                                                                                                                            Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !\\n33                                                                                                                                                      I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\n34

                            The staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                         There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .\\n37

tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                               There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .\\n40

concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                       Their service was of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .\\n42                                                     One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                       They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .\\n46                                                                                                                             We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   We were very

around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n51

                                                                                                                                                                                                 very

                                                           The hotel makes a big thing of the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .\\n54

happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n55

run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .\\n60                                                                                                         Lunch and dinner room

                                           We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, we chose to eat at the IHOP around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service, and they are open 24

service, as there was no information about that anywhere .\\n74   The hotel is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast

late at night and we couldn't find any vending machines for soda or snacks, so stop at a nearby market before going in for the night .\\n6

night and scare my mother or pay for a taxi or bus, but sit around and eat comfortably in my pajamas was well worth the cost to me .\\n8

service was extortionate though, very very expensive, so we didnt bother, as food outlets a few minutes walk away .\\n11

chicago food tasting tour which you can find here on travelzoo, this was fantastic and well worth the $40 pp .\\n12

store your own food personal items, the sensor will send a signal to the hotel and you will be charged .\\n13

the restaurants simply because the cost of breakfast was insane and the food tends to be mediocre .\\n14

                   Also don't forget to go the &quot The River North&quot  for great food .\\n15

tray charge plus 20% service, I then absolutely refuse to tip for delivery .\\n17

.\\n3                                                                                                         They have a parking garage, but they make you leave your vehicle for them to park   and then if you want to take a drive later, you have to wait for the staff to get it .\\n4

night and valet only, which becomes a pain .\\n16

expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .\\n19

this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it\\u0092s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22

while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24

We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                          The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .\\n27

area .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                            First, the biggest &quot gotcha&quot  is the mandatory valet parking .\\n29                                                                                                                               Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                          The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .\\n32

.\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .\\n34

details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37

available .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                             I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .\\n39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                            Valet parking is provided at $36 day which was, I thought, excessive .\\n41

was cold .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          At the hotel, it is valet only parking .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                              I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\\n50

Several have mentioned the charge for parking .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                     It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n52                                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Another irritant was the crazy parking fees for the hotel .\\n54

                                            Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .\\n60

                              staff were helpful although the valet parking and the laundry costs were extremely expensive .\\n62

too much money to pay for parking, but that is the way it is in San Francisco .\\n64

Parking at the hotel is expensive at $32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in out privilages .\\n67

the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :\\n69                                                                                                           I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\\n70               All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                               Parking at the hotel was a hefty $32 per day with unlimited in and out privileges .\\n72

expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                          Because of the exhorbitant $29 valet parking fee, we only rented a car for Sonoma and Napa for one day .\\n75

                                               And, conveniently, there is a Safeway and a drug store hidden in the parking garage across the street .\\n85

  Note to those with a car, overnight valet parking is $26 but right next door the car park is $15 and it takes about 30 seconds to get from your car back to the hotel ,  why pay $26 ?\\n88
